    <h3>About me:</h3>
    <p>Hi, I'm Caleb Warner, software developer, Jesus lover, and pun enthusiast!</p>
    <p>This is my website where I will shortly be uploading projects and other computer science accomplishments
        I've achieved over my years developing. It's still a work in progress, so stay tuned for more!</p>
    <p>Though, this website is itself an accomplishment. This website is a Java Spring Boot application deployed
        on an Amazon Web Services EC2 instance using a Docker container and hosted on a GoDaddy domain! If that doesn't mean anything to you,
        then just pretend it's really impressive. And if that does mean something to you, it means I have
        experience in Java, Spring Boot, AWS, and Docker!</p>
    <p>Come back in a couple weeks to see more content, projects, and more!</p>
